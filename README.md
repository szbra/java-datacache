# Java Cache Web Starter Overview

The Java Cache Web Starter demonstrates how to use the Bluemix Data Cache service. The app lets the user enter key-value pairs to cache, then lookup or delete keys and change existing cached values.

When deploying to Bluemix, name the app "sample-java-cache" instead of the generated name. Also note that the Data Cache service does not have a free plan. The "Shared" plan is used instead.
